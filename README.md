Welcome to Bang! - an Entity Component System framework in C#.
</p>

### How does it work?
This is not, in any way, an engine, but rather a framework that you can use in whatever engine you're comfortable with. This is currently integrated with [Murder engine](https://github.com/isadorasophia/murder).

Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/isadorasophia/bang/wiki) for more details.

### How to use it?
We are on nuget! So you can either use this repository as a submodule or simply add:

```csproj
<PackageReference Include="Murder.Bang" Version="0.0.2-alpha" />
```

Whatever makes you happier. The nuget package should have symbols and source embedded available with Source Link.

### Real-life examples
[Neo City Express](https://github.com/isadorasophia/neocityexpress) was a Ludum Dare game (made in 72h ⏰) built on top of **Murder** and **Bang**. I highly recommend checking it out, especially if you're good with learning from examples.
